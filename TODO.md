1. Implement PDP (Provable Data Possession) for this Blockchain:

- [ ] Divide/Separate `whole data storage` into multiple equality parts.
- [ ] Implement Diffie-Hellman or RSA in each block to be used as verification proofs later.

2. Optimization:

- [ ] Optimizing the net.Dial to open connection between ports in `network.go`.
- [ ] Implement the case of pulling block for neighbor node when its depth is less than our local.
